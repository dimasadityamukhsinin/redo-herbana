              We collect Device Information using the following technologies:

              collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet

            <p>HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</p>
            <p>
              We use the Order Information that we collect generally to fulfill
              any orders placed through the Site (including processing your

              with invoices and/or order confirmations). Additionally, we use
              this Order Information to:

              generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact
              with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and
              advertising campaigns).
